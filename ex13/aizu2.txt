In the Edo era, the Aizu region came to be well-known as a han (feudal clan) devoted to education of children. This was characterized by the school of the Aizu clan with traditions, Nisshinkan. However, as there was no 4-year university in the Aizu region, the Fukushima Prefectural Government determined to establish a prefectural university in this region where people carried on the tradition of being enthusiastic about children's education.
